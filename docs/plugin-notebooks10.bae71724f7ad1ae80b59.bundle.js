We need the power to go off the\nrails. But **ASCII is tedious**. Kui takes your normal kubectl command\nline requests and responds with graphics. Instead of ASCII tables, you\nare presented with sortable ones. Instead of copying and pasting long\nauto-generated resource names to drill down, in Kui **you just\nclick**.\n\n## Installation\n\n=== "Mac"\n\n    For MacOS, this is simplified by the use of [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):\n\n    ```bash\n    ---\n    id: kui-installation-mac\n    validate: brew info kui\n    ---\n    brew install kui\n    kubectl kui get pods\n    ```\n\n=== "Linux and Windows"\n    \n    [Kui-Linux-x64.zip](https://linux-zip.kui-shell.org) **|** [Kui-Linux-arm64.zip](https://linux-arm64-zip.kui-shell.org) **|** [Kui-Win32-x64.zip](https://win32-zip.kui-shell.org)\n\n### Contributing\n\nKui uses [Electron](https://electronjs.org). Using Electron, Kui can\nbe distributed as a double-clickable platform application, as a static\nsingle-page web application, or as a fully hosted client-server web\napp.\n\nIf you want to help, please take a look at the [developer\nguide](https://github.com/IBM/kui/wiki) and our\n[guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n---\n\n???+ tip "Kui as a `kubectl` plugin"\n\n    To run Kui as `kubectl kui`, add the unpacked directory to your\n    PATH. For users of Homebrew on macOS, this should happen automatically.\n\n## Listing Kubernetes Resources and Drilling Down\n\nTo use Kui, type a normal `kubectl` command, and you should quickly\nsee interactive graphics in response. You may use `k` as a shorthand\nfor `kubectl`.\n\nFirst, let us try viewing our pods:\n\n```bash\nk get pods\n```\n\nClicking on a table cell gives you a quick way to drill down the\nfollowing details:\n\n```bash\nk get Pod frontend-6c6d6dfd4d-h6htk -o yaml\n```\n\n### Events\n\nKui has enhanced views over Kubernetes events.\n\n```bash\nk get events\n```\n\n## Viewing an Kubernetes Application\n\nKui also has enhanced views over heterogeneous collections of\nresources. Both `apply` and `get` operations present a unified view of\nthese resources, along with links to view the source yaml for each\ngroup of resources.\n\n```bash\nk apply -f plugins/plugin-kubectl/tests/data/k8s/application/guestbook/\n```\n'}}]);
