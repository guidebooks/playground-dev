The\nrest of the text in this section is our interpretations of these\nterms.\n\n### Node Terminology\n\nEach node has a cpu and a memory share that can be allocated to\ncontainers. The two pertinent figures are:\n\n    - "Capacity": total cpu/memory share\n    - "Allocatable": remaining cpu/memory share\n\n### Container Terminology\n\nEach container will request resource shares from its owning node. The\nresource requests can be constrained in two ways:\n\n    - "Limit": maximum cpu/memory share to grant the container\n    - "Request": minimal cpu/memory share it needs in order to function\n\n## Credits\n\nOriginated from: https://github.com/etopeter/kubectl-view-utilization/\n'}}]);
